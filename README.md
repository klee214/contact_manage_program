# contact_manage_program

This program is contact management system for saving contact information.
Users can save their names, address and phone numbers. There are options of whether they
enter middle initials, apartment numbers and home, business and cell phone numbers.

There are 3 modules. Contact module (getting information from users and retrieve it for users..etc), ContactHelper(Helping the Contact module) and main module.

This simple program is my first complete program.
The codes are whole written in C.
